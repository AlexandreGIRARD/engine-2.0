# PBR Engine

This is my second OpenGL engine were the purpose of this project is to learn other rendering techniques and improve both my C++ and OpenGL knowledge.

It's a deferred rendering engine based on the glTF file format. 

## Features

### Implemented
- Physically Based Rendering
  - Metallic Roughness Workflow
  - IBL
- Skybox
- Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
- Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing
- Debug Mode

## To transfer from the old Engine
- Shadow Mapping (Both Directional and Point)
- Relief Mapping
- Water Rendering

## To Implement
See issues
- Bloom
- Depth of Field
- Specular Glossiness Workflow
- Post Fx effects
  - Grain
  - Chromatic Aberration
  - Lens-Flare  
- Other Anti-Aliasing Algorithms
- Other Ambien Occlusion Algorithms
